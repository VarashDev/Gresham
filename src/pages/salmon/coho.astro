<h2>
    <strong>Introduction to Coho Salmon Fishing in Oregon</strong>
</h2>
<h3>
    <strong>What Are Coho Salmon?</strong>
</h3>
<p>
    Coho salmon, also known as Silver salmon, are a prized species for sport fishing in Oregon. They typically weigh between 8 and 12 pounds, though some can exceed 15 pounds. Known for their acrobatic fights and delicious meat, Coho are a favorite among both recreational and subsistence fishers.
</p>
<h3>
    <strong>Differences Between Coho and Chinook</strong>
</h3>
<p>
    While both are Pacific salmon species, Coho differ from Chinook in several ways:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Size:</strong> Coho are generally smaller than Chinook.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Appearance:</strong> Coho have brighter silver sides and a more pronounced hooked jaw (kype) during spawning.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Behavior:</strong> Coho often swim closer to shore and can be easier to catch from the bank.
    </li>
</ul>
<h3>
    <strong>Why Gresham is a Hotspot</strong>
</h3>
<p>
    Gresham’s location near the confluence of key Coho rivers makes it a strategic base for anglers. Within 30 minutes, you can access multiple productive streams, ensuring flexibility depending on river flow, run timing, and crowd levels.
</p>
<h2>
    <strong>Seasonal Timing for Coho Runs</strong>
</h2>
<h3>
    <strong>Best Months to Fish</strong>
</h3>
<p>
    The primary Coho salmon run in Oregon typically occurs between <strong>late August and early November</strong>. Peak fishing times around Gresham are usually in <strong>September and October</strong>.
</p>
<h3>
    <strong>Early vs Late Runs</strong>
</h3>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Early Run Coho:</strong> Often smaller in size but more aggressive.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Late Run Coho:</strong> Larger and more mature, but sometimes more cautious and selective.
    </li>
</ul>
<h3>
    <strong>Impact of Weather Patterns</strong>
</h3>
<p>
    Rainfall plays a vital role in salmon migration. Heavy rain can swell rivers and encourage salmon to move upstream, making timing your trip with a fresh rainfall especially strategic.
</p>
<h2>
    <strong>Top Fishing Spots Near Gresham</strong>
</h2>
<h3>
    <strong>Sandy River</strong>
</h3>
<p>
    The Sandy River is arguably the crown jewel for Coho fishing near Gresham. Its cool, fast-moving waters and deep pools attract large numbers of Coho.

<h2>
    <strong>Fishing Techniques for Coho Salmon</strong>
</h2>
<h3>
    <strong>Casting vs Drifting</strong>
</h3>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Casting:</strong> Effective in pools and when Coho are actively chasing lures
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Drifting:</strong> Best for subtle presentations in slower water
    </li>
</ul>
<h3>
    <strong>Jigging for Coho</strong>
</h3>
<p>
    Twitching jigs under overhanging trees or behind boulders can provoke aggressive strikes.
</p>
<h3>
    <strong>Fly Fishing Opportunities</strong>
</h3>
<p>
    Use large, flashy streamers during early morning or overcast days. A 7 or 8-weight fly rod is recommended.
</p>
<h2>

<h2>
    <strong>Coho Salmon Behavior and Habitat</strong>
</h2>
<h3>
    <strong>Preferred Water Temperatures</strong>
</h3>
<p>
    Coho salmon thrive in waters ranging from <strong>50°F to 58°F</strong>. They become less active when the temperature exceeds 60°F or falls below 45°F, so monitoring water conditions can significantly impact your success.
</p>
<h3>
    <strong>Migration Patterns</strong>
</h3>
<p>
    Coho typically begin their upriver migration from the ocean in <strong>late summer</strong>, triggered by changes in water temperature and flow. They travel from the Columbia River into tributaries like the Sandy River, often holding in deep pools or slow eddies during their upstream journey.
</p>
<h3>
    <strong>Feeding Habits</strong>
</h3>
<p>
    While adult Coho stop feeding once they enter freshwater, they remain aggressive and will strike at flashy or erratic lures, especially during early stages of their migration.
</p>
<h2>
    <strong>Best Times of Day to Fish Coho</strong>
</h2>
<h3>
    <strong>Morning vs Evening Bites</strong>
</h3>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Morning:</strong> Coho are generally more active during low light periods, especially just after dawn.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Evening:</strong> Late afternoon and dusk can also be productive, particularly on cloudy days.
    </li>
</ul>
<h3>
    <strong>Tidal Influence</strong>
</h3>
<p>
    In tidal stretches of the Columbia River, incoming tides can push new fish into the system, making high tide an ideal time to fish.
</p>
<h3>
    <strong>Cloud Cover and Light Penetration</strong>
</h3>
<p>
    Overcast conditions reduce light penetration, making fish feel more secure and increasing their willingness to bite.
</p>
<h2>
    <strong>Weather and Water Conditions</strong>
</h2>
<h3>
    <strong>How Rain Affects River Clarity</strong>
</h3>
<p>
    Rainfall can stir up sediment, reducing visibility. While murky water can be a challenge, it can also provide cover for salmon, making them less cautious.
</p>
<h3>
    <strong>Ideal Flow Rates</strong>
</h3>
<p>
    Look for <strong>moderate flows</strong> — too fast, and the fish hold back; too slow, and they become wary. Tools like the USGS streamflow gauge for the Sandy River can help you plan accordingly.
</p>
<h3>
    <strong>Safety During Storms</strong>
</h3>
<p>
    Fast-rising rivers and slippery terrain pose risks. Always wear a life vest when wading or boating, and never fish alone in extreme weather.
</p>

        Support fish upright in the water until they swim away on their own.
    </li>
</ul>
<h3>
    <strong>Legal Responsibilities</strong>

    <strong>Introduction to Pink Salmon Fishing in Gresham, Oregon</strong>
</h2>
<p>
    Nestled between the grandeur of Mount Hood and the lush Columbia River Gorge, <strong>Gresham, Oregon</strong> is a prime yet often overlooked location for <strong>pink salmon fishing</strong>. Whether you’re a seasoned angler or a curious beginner, this area offers the perfect blend of natural beauty and fish-rich waters.
</p>
<p>
    Pink salmon, also known as humpies due to the distinctive hump males develop during spawning, migrate to Oregon’s rivers every odd-numbered year. And when they do, rivers near Gresham like the Sandy and Columbia come alive with opportunities.

    From knowing the right time to fish to gearing up properly and understanding local regulations, this guide will walk you through every essential aspect of pink salmon fishing near Gresham.

    <strong>Understanding Pink Salmon: A Quick Guide</strong>
</h2>
<h3>
    <strong>Physical Characteristics and Life Cycle</strong>
</h3>
<p>
    Pink salmon are the smallest of the Pacific salmon species, typically weighing between 3 to 5 pounds. Their life cycle is short — just two years — and they return to freshwater to spawn and die. During the spawning run, males develop a humped back, hooked jaws, and striking coloration.
</p>
<h3>
    <strong>Spawning Behavior in Oregon Waters</strong>
</h3>
<p>
    While pink salmon aren’t as common in Oregon as in Washington or Alaska, they do migrate into tributaries of the Columbia River every odd-numbered year. They spawn in shallow, gravel-bottomed streams, which makes them accessible to bank fishers near Gresham.

<h2>
    <strong>Top Fishing Spots Near Gresham for Pink Salmon</strong>
</h2>
<h3>
    <strong>Sandy River Hotspots</strong>
</h3>
<p>
    Popular access points include Dabney State Recreation Area and Lewis and Clark State Park. These offer both wading and bank fishing options, and are known for consistent pink salmon action during peak run times.
</p>
<h3>
    <strong>Columbia River Bank Access Points</strong>
</h3>
<p>
    Try Chinook Landing Marine Park and Rooster Rock State Park. These provide ample space, parking, and sometimes even docks that give you better reach into the salmon's paths.
</p>
<h3>
    <strong>Tributaries and Lesser-Known Streams</strong>
</h3>
<p>
    Smaller creeks like Beaver Creek and Johnson Creek can also harbor pink salmon during the run. These spots are great for solitude and fly fishing.
</p>
<h2>
    <strong>Essential Gear for Pink Salmon Fishing</strong>
</h2>
<h3>
    <strong>Rods, Reels, and Line Strengths</strong>
</h3>
<p>
    For pink salmon, a <strong>medium-light spinning rod (6-9 ft)</strong> paired with a <strong>2000-3000 size reel</strong> works best. Use a 6-12 lb test line — strong enough to handle their fight but light enough to feel the bites.
</p>
<h3>
    <strong>Best Lures and Baits for Pink Salmon</strong>
</h3>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Lures:</strong> Pink spoons, spinners, and jigs.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Baits:</strong> Cured salmon eggs, shrimp, or sand shrimp.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Tips:</strong> Use pink or chartreuse colors for best visibility in Oregon’s often cloudy river waters.
    </li>
</ul>
<h2>
    <strong>Fishing Techniques That Work Best in Oregon Waters</strong>
</h2>
<h3>
    <strong>Drift Fishing vs. Plunking</strong>
</h3>
<p>
    <strong>Drift fishing</strong> is ideal for narrow rivers like the Sandy. It allows your bait to move naturally with the current. <strong>Plunking</strong>, meanwhile, works better on wider rivers like the Columbia, especially when targeting deeper holding fish.
</p>
<h3>
    <strong>Fly Fishing Strategies</strong>
</h3>
<p>
    Fly anglers can have success using small pink streamers or egg patterns. Target riffles and seams where salmon tend to rest on their upstream journey.
</p>

    <strong>Introduction to Chum Salmon Fishing in Oregon</strong>
</h2>
<p>
    Fishing for chum salmon in Oregon offers anglers a thrilling adventure packed with powerful runs, beautiful surroundings, and a strong sense of tradition. Chum salmon, also known as "dog salmon" due to the hooked jaws of spawning males, are a hardy species known for their aggressive nature and impressive size—often weighing between 10 to 20 pounds.
</p>
<p>
    These fish are prized not only for the fight they put up but also for the cultural and ecological roles they play in Pacific Northwest waterways. Found in many coastal and inland rivers, chum salmon return each year to spawn in streams around the region, including those near Gresham, Oregon.
</p>
<h2>
    <strong>Why Gresham, Oregon Is a Prime Spot for Chum Salmon Fishing</strong>
</h2>
<h3>
    <strong>Geography and Waterways</strong>
</h3>
<p>
    Located at the gateway to the Columbia River Gorge, Gresham is uniquely positioned near a network of rivers and creeks that chum salmon use during their spawning run. The Sandy River and its tributaries are especially active during late fall, making them a go-to destination for local anglers.
</p>
<h3>
    <strong>Local Fishing Culture</strong>
</h3>
<p>
    The area has a vibrant fishing community that values conservation, skill-sharing, and seasonal participation. From weekend hobbyists to seasoned pros, the people around Gresham understand and respect the cycles of salmon migration and contribute to sustainable fishing practices.
</p>
<h2>
    <strong>Best Times of Year to Fish for Chum Salmon</strong>
</h2>
<h3>
    <strong>Peak Seasons (October to December)</strong>
</h3>
<p>
    The best time to catch chum salmon near Gresham is between <strong>late October and early December</strong>. This window aligns with their spawning season when they travel upstream in large numbers. Mornings after a fresh rainfall often produce the best action.
</p>
<h3>
    <strong>Ideal Weather Conditions</strong>
</h3>
<p>
    Cool, overcast days with moderate rainfall are prime conditions. The cloud cover helps fish feel safer from predators, and increased water flow allows easier upstream migration, making them more aggressive and easier to target.
</p>
<h2>
    <strong>Top Fishing Spots Near Gresham for Chum Salmon</strong>
</h2>
<h3>
    <strong>Sandy River</strong>
</h3>
<p>
    A favorite among local anglers, the Sandy River provides multiple access points for chum salmon. Look for deeper holes and slower-moving water sections, especially around Oxbow Regional Park.
</p>
<h3>
    <strong>Columbia River Tributaries</strong>
</h3>
<p>
    Several smaller rivers and creeks that feed into the Columbia River host healthy runs of chum salmon. These include Beaver Creek and the Washougal River, just across the state line.
</p>
<h3>
    <strong>Clackamas River Access Points</strong>
</h3>
<p>
    Though better known for coho and chinook, the Clackamas River can surprise you with late-fall chum runs. Barton Park and Carver are great spots to scout during peak season.
</p>
<p>

<h2>
    <strong>Licenses and Regulations You Need to Know</strong>
</h2>
<h3>
    <strong>Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife Rules</strong>
</h3>
<p>
    Before casting your line, it's crucial to check the current regulations set by the <strong>Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife (ODFW)</strong>. Chum salmon fishing near Gresham is subject to seasonal and location-based restrictions, often changing yearly to protect the population.
</p>
<p>
    Anglers aged 12 and older must have a valid Oregon fishing license. Additionally, a Combined Angling Tag is required for salmon fishing, along with a Columbia River Basin Endorsement if you plan to fish in tributaries connected to the Columbia River.
</p>
<h3>
    <strong>Daily Bag Limits and Legal Gear</strong>
</h3>
<p>
    Regulations typically limit the number of chum salmon you can keep per day. The current rule (as of 2024) generally allows <strong>one or two salmon per day</strong>, but always verify this with the ODFW’s online regulation updates.
</p>
<p>
    Legal gear includes single-point barbless hooks and artificial lures or bait. Snagging is strictly prohibited, and ethical angling methods are encouraged to minimize fish stress and injury.
</p>
<h2>
    <strong>Essential Gear for Chum Salmon Fishing</strong>
</h2>
<h3>
    <strong>Rods, Reels, and Lines</strong>
</h3>
<p>
    Chum salmon are strong fighters, so a <strong>medium-heavy spinning or baitcasting rod</strong> (8 to 10 feet long) is ideal. Match it with a quality reel that can hold at least 150 yards of <strong>15-30 lb test line</strong>.
</p>
<p>
    Braided line offers strength and sensitivity, while a fluorocarbon leader helps maintain stealth in clear waters.
</p>
<h3>
    <strong>Recommended Bait and Lures</strong>
</h3>
<p>
    Chum salmon are aggressive during spawning, responding well to brightly colored lures like pink, chartreuse, or purple. Effective options include:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Corkies and yarn combos
    </li>
    <li>
        Twitching jigs
    </li>
    <li>
        Spinners (like Blue Fox or Mepps)
    </li>
    <li>
        Cured salmon eggs or shrimp
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Experimenting with scent attractants can also improve your success rate.
</p>

    <strong>Shore Fishing vs. Boat Fishing Near Gresham</strong>
</h2>
<h3>
    <strong>Pros and Cons</strong>
</h3>
<p>
    <strong>Shore fishing</strong> is easily accessible, especially along the Sandy River, and requires less equipment. It’s perfect for beginners or those looking for a quick fishing trip.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Boat fishing</strong>, on the other hand, gives access to deeper pools and less-pressured spots. However, it demands more preparation, permits, and safety precautions.
</p>
<h3>
    <strong>Best Locations for Each Method</strong>
</h3>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Shore Fishing</strong>: Oxbow Regional Park, Dabney State Recreation Area
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Boat Fishing</strong>: Lower stretches of the Sandy River or where it meets the Columbia River
    </li>
</ul>
<h2>
    <strong>Techniques for Catching Chum Salmon</strong>
</h2>
<h3>
    <strong>Drift Fishing</strong>
</h3>
<p>
    This classic method involves casting upstream and letting your bait drift naturally with the current. It’s highly effective in rivers like the Sandy and Clackamas.
</p>
<h3>
    <strong>Float Fishing</strong>
</h3>
<p>
    Using a bobber or float allows you to suspend bait just above the riverbed, which is ideal in slower-moving waters or near log jams where chum may congregate.
</p>
<h3>
    <strong>Fly Fishing Strategies</strong>
</h3>
<p>
    While not as common, some anglers enjoy the challenge of catching chum on flies. Use brightly colored patterns with strong hooks, and focus on swing techniques in shallow tailouts.

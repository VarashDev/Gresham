<h2>
    <strong>Why Winter Steelhead Fishing is Popular in Oregon</strong>
</h2>
<p>
    Oregon stands out on the fishing map thanks to its rich waters and predictable seasonal steelhead runs. Winter brings a unique challenge: cold, swift rivers and elusive fish. Yet that’s exactly what makes it so exhilarating.
</p>
<p>
    Steelhead trout, known for their strength and acrobatics, return to spawn during colder months. This migration draws hundreds of anglers to the Gresham area each winter, hoping for that perfect catch.
</p>
<h2>
    <strong>Understanding Steelhead Trout Migration Patterns</strong>
</h2>
<p>
    Steelhead are sea-run rainbow trout. There are two main types:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Winter-run Steelhead</strong>: Enter freshwater sexually mature and spawn soon after arrival.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Summer-run Steelhead</strong>: Enter rivers earlier and spawn later, often overwintering in rivers.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    In Gresham, you’re primarily targeting <strong>winter-run steelhead</strong>, which begin appearing in rivers like the Sandy and Clackamas from December through March.
</p>
<h2>
    <strong>Best Time to Fish for Winter Steelhead</strong>
</h2>
<p>
    Timing is everything. The peak for winter steelhead fishing in Gresham falls between <strong>January and early March</strong>. Key conditions include:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Water Temperature</strong>: Ideal range is 38°F to 45°F.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>River Flow</strong>: Look for moderate flows after a rain; fish move upstream when rivers rise.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Early mornings and overcast days often bring better results.
</p>

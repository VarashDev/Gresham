<h2>
    Introduction: Why Gresham Is Ideal for Steelhead Fishing
</h2>
<p>
    Nestled at the crossroads of the <strong>Sandy River</strong>, <strong>Clackamas River</strong>, and <strong>Columbia River system</strong>, <strong>Gresham, Oregon</strong> is an underrated steelhead fishing hub. With year-round access to wild and hatchery steelhead runs, local anglers enjoy one of the state's most exciting freshwater challenges just minutes from home. Whether you're fishing from the bank, swinging flies, or side-drifting from a drift boat, Gresham offers incredible steelhead action throughout the seasons.
</p>
<h2>
    Steelhead Species and Run Timing in the Region
</h2>
<p>
    Two primary steelhead runs occur near Gresham:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Winter Steelhead</strong>: Arrive from <strong>December to March</strong>, often weighing 8–14 lbs. These fish are aggressive and found in higher water flows.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Summer Steelhead</strong>: Migrate in <strong>May–October</strong>. These smaller but spirited fish often move further upstream in lower, clearer water.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Both runs offer excellent angling opportunities with varied techniques depending on water conditions and time of year.
</p>
<h2>
    Best Rivers for Steelhead Fishing Near Gresham
</h2>
<h3>
    Sandy River
</h3>
<p>
    One of the premier steelhead rivers in Oregon, the Sandy receives robust hatchery returns and offers accessible fishing from both banks and boats. Prime areas include <strong>Oxbow Park</strong>, <strong>Dabney State Recreation Area</strong>, and <strong>Cedar Creek</strong>, where the Sandy Hatchery is located.
</p>
<h3>
    Clackamas River
</h3>
<p>
    Located just south of Gresham, this river supports <strong>summer steelhead</strong> and <strong>early winter fish</strong>. Great access from <strong>Barton Park</strong>, <strong>McIver State Park</strong>, and <strong>Carver Park</strong> makes it a local favorite for both wading and boating.
</p>
<h3>
    Columbia River Tributaries
</h3>
<p>
    While less targeted specifically for steelhead, the Columbia and its confluences (especially near <strong>Troutdale</strong>) can produce steelhead bites when water clarity and conditions align.

        <strong>Change lures often</strong>—sometimes a new presentation triggers strikes.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Cover water</strong>—don’t wait too long in one spot; steelhead are migratory.
    </li>
    <li>
